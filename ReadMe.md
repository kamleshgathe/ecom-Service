## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 17](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk17-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Gradle](https://ww.gradle.org)

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `de.codecentric.springbootsample.Application` class from your IDE.
